Members Only
==================
Extension to make your phpBB for members only

This phpbb 3.1.x extension will make it so that any non-logged in user will be redirected to the login page. This is done by means of core events, so there is no need to update templates or anything else.

This allows for user registration (or any other module run by the ucp file), if it is enabled.

## Install:
Place in your boards ext directory:
    `[Your phpBB install dir]/ext/tecktron/membersonly`

Enable in your ACP:
    `"ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" > "Members Only" > "Enable"`

#### Version Info:
* 0.1.0 - Initial Release
